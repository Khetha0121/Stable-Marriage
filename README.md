This code implements the Stable Marriage Algorithm for matching students with universities based on their ranked preferences.

How It Works:
Each student proposes to their most preferred university.
Universities accept/reject based on their preferences.
If a university prefers a new student, it drops the previous match, and that student becomes free.
The process continues until all students are matched with universities
